# Roadmap

Pyspread 1.x only works with Python 2.x. 
Development concentrates on fixing bugs and maintaining compatibility.
Its source code currently is located in the 
[master branch](https://github.com/manns/pyspread/tree/python2){:target="_blank"}.

Pyspread 2.x will be Python3 compatible. It is under heavy development and
not yet ready for production use.  Its source code currently is located in the
[python3 branch](https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread){:target="_blank"}.
New features should be developed against pyspread 2.x. 

The switch to Python3 goes along with changing the GUI toolkit from 
[wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org){:target="_blank"} to 
[PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt){:target="_blank"}.
This change requires a major rewrite of the GUI part of pyspread.
For an overview of current and future tasks for realizing pyspread 2.0,
please refer to the 
[to do list](https://github.com/manns/pyspread/wiki/Pyspread-development){:target="_blank"}.
